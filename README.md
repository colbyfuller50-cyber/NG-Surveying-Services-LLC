# N.G. Surveying Services LLC — SAM-style website

This package is a SAM-like, professional website template for N.G. Surveying Services LLC.

## What's included
- `index.html` — Home page with hero banner, about, services, gallery, and request CTA.
- `contact.html` — Separate contact page with form and Google Maps embed.
- `style.css` — Styling matching a clean, SAM-like layout with red/navy branding.
- `images/logo.png` — Your provided logo (placed in `images/`).
- Images in the HTML are referenced from Unsplash (remote).

## Deploy
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g., `ng-surveying-website`).
2. Upload all files and folders from this ZIP to the repo root.
3. In GitHub Repository Settings -> Pages, choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, Save.
4. After a few minutes, your site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/ng-surveying-website/`

## Notes
- The contact form uses `mailto:` for demonstration; for production use consider Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a backend.
- Replace Unsplash image URLs with your own photos by placing them in `images/` and updating the `src` values in the HTML.
